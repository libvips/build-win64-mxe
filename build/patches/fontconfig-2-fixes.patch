Subject: [PATCH 1/1] Ignore an error when loading the default config file

This error can be safely ignored since Windows doesn't ship
a fonts.conf file. It can also be disabled by setting the
"FONTCONFIG_PATH" environment variable, but that is kinda
awkward on Windows. The default fallback config file loaded
from memory fits our needs anyway.
