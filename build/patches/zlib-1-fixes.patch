Subject: [PATCH 3/3] Zlib patch: prevent uninitialized use of state->check

This CL fixes a security bug in zlib. It was reported upstream long ago
and the testcase was shared upstream but it's yet unsolved. As a fix,
state->check is set to the same value as the adler32 of an empty string.

Upstream bug: madler/zlib#245

Upstream-Status: Pending [https://github.com/madler/zlib/issues/245]
